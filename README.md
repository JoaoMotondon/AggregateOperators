# AggregateOperators
This project is the seventh part of a series of 10 articles about RxJava operators. It contains some examples of the mathematical and aggregate operators that operate on the entire sequence of items emitted by an Observable.

Here is a list of all examples available in this project:

  - sumInteger()
  - max()
  - collect()
  - reduce()
  - reduce(w/global seed)
  - reduce(w/local seed)

Please, refer to [this article](http://androidahead.com/2017/12/21/rxjava-operators-part-7-mathematical-and-aggregate-operators/) for detailed information.
